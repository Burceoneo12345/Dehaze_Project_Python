## Introduction
* run ```./code/DCP/HazeRemoval.py``` to remove the haze from picture by DCP
  * change ```./code/DCP/images/test_list.txt``` and add the hazy images in the folder```./code/DCP/images/haze```
* run ```./code/GridDehazeNet/Dehaze_tool.py``` to remove the haze from picture by GridDehazeNet. The Original Code is [here](https://github.com/proteus1991/GridDehazeNet)
